/**
 * YOUR TDD TEST FILE
 *
 * This is where YOU write YOUR tests following TDD principles!
 *
 * The tests in drivingLicense.test.ts are ACCEPTANCE tests - they verify your final solution.
 * But THIS file is where you practice TDD by writing tests FIRST, then implementing code to pass them.
 *
 * TDD Process:
 * 1. Write a test below (it will fail - RED ❌)
 * 2. Write minimal code in src/drivingLicense.ts to make it pass (GREEN ✅)
 * 3. Refactor your code if needed (REFACTOR 🔄)
 * 4. Repeat!
 *
 * Start simple! Maybe begin with:
 * - Can you format a surname correctly?
 * - Can you extract initials?
 * - Can you parse a date string?
 * - Can you calculate the decade digit?
 *
 * Then build up to the full solution.
 *
 * Run YOUR tests with: npm run test
 * Run acceptance tests with: npm run check
